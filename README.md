# WASI.dev

WASI.dev is an introduction to [the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/tree/main) for users of all backgrounds and levels of experience with WebAssembly. The site is under active development by volunteers coordinated through the Bytecode Alliance's Special Interest Group for Documentation. 

### Local development

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). After forking this repository, you can build and start a development server with `npm install` and `npm start`. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. Open a PR to the `main` branch of the `bytecodealliance/wasi.dev` repo to contribute.

### Get involved
