WASI.dev is an introduction to [WASI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/tree/main) for users of all backgrounds. The site is under active development by volunteers coordinated through the Bytecode Alliance's Special Interest Group for Documentation. If you're interested in getting involved, you can find us on the SIG Documentation channel of the [Bytecode Alliance's Zulip server](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/), or [contribute on the WASI.dev GitHub repo](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi.dev).

### Local development
